    <H2>Kirby's history</H2>    
<P >Kirby is a Japanese Character that starred in many mangas and shows and games.</p>
 <p>Kirby's signature skill is his ability to inhale objects or creatures and spit them out as projectiles, as well as the ability to suck in air to float over obstacles. His Copy Ability grants him the power to adopt the abilities of the creatures he inhales, while also wearing various costumes or transforming his shape. He uses these abilities to rescue various lands, such as his homeworld Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as Dark Matter or Nightmare. On these adventures, he often crosses paths with his rivals, King Dedede and Meta Knight. In virtually all of his appearances, Kirby is depicted as a cheerful, innocent, and food-loving character.</P>

    <p>Kirby has been regarded as one of the most iconic video game characters of all time, as well as one of the cutest and most lovable. He has achieved high popularity with gamers in Japan. He has also been praised for being one of the most versatile characters, due to starring in a large catalogue of games that cuts across a variety of video game genres.

    <p>Kirby made his debut on the Game Boy in 1992 in Kirby's Dream Land, a 2D side-scrolling platform game that introduced his ability to suck, swallow, and spit out enemies as projectiles alongside other moves such as running, jumping and flying. The obtainable food items in the game act as power-ups and grant him a variety of abilities. Upon reaching the end of a level, Kirby confronts a final boss, such as Whispy Woods or King Dedede. Due to the Game Boy screen's limited colour palette, he appeared in grey rather than his typical pink hue. A year later, Kirby's Adventure on the NES introduced his copy ability and other moves, such as the ability to dash and slide kick, and a recurring rival named Meta Knight. Kirby's appearance was nearly identical to his previous iteration, although he was slightly shorter, his body was rendered in pink and his face was enhanced with dark pink ovals. He again combats King Dedede, but must also defeat an entity named Nightmare, whom he accidentally releases with the Star Rod. In 1995, another platform game was released on the Game Boy titled Kirby's Dream Land 2. Kirby is accompanied by three animal friends who aid him during his adventure named Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the fish. His in-game appearance was returned to grey, and he was slightly taller than his NES incarnation, although he is pink in the game's box art. In the extended finale, Kirby battles a boss called Dark Matter, an entity that transforms into a one-eyed black orb. In 1996, Kirby Super Star was released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, a compilation of eight mini-games, such as Gourmet Race, where Kirby races against King Dedede in a food collecting competition. It was the first game to introduce helpers controlled by the game or by another player and also gave Kirby various hats to illustrate his various copy abilities. In 1997, Kirby's Dream Land 3, which released on the SNES, introduced new animal friends for Kirby, including Nago the cat and ChuChu the octopus. Kirby again defeats Dark Matter, only to face a monstrous white entity with a single eye named Zero.</p>
